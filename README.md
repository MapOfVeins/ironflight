# IronFlight v0.01

IronFlight is a simple Android app with minimal (approaching no) design.  Simply select exercises and build your workout routine and IronFlight will generate a rating for the routine, telling you what you may need to change.  The review is based on three criteria:

### Get it

~~Download IronFlight from the Google Play store [here](play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cjkenned.ironflight).~~

This app is no longer available in the Play store :( It's old and not maintained or even looked at, but remains as a relic of my development journey.

### Volume

How many reps are you doing per muscle group?

### Difficulty

How hard are the exercises you are doing?  For example, deadlifts are harder to perform than curls.

### Balance

Are you training each muscle group enough?  Or, conversely, are you overtraining certain muscles?

### Disclaimer

IronFlight can only make suggestions.  The results of the critique should not be considered hard rules to training, but only as suggestions that can be used to improve your training.  Nobody knows your own body an training better than you!
